# DBB - Table Generator

The German Basketball Association (Deutscher Basketball Bund) is not sharing ranking tables for childrens leagues. Therefore I created this little script to generate a table based on the publically available game results.

**Example:** [Berlin U9 Mini League](https://code.mathiasnitzsche.de/bball/)

**Usage:** `?id=[ID]` allows to provide league ID, which can be found on [www.basketball-bund.de]
